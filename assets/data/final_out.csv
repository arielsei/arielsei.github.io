Just because a film is about identity, anymore than it is about any important subject like the Holocaust, doesn't make it a great film in a cinematic sense. Now Oscar falls all over itself for ""important"" films about the Holocaust and Slavery, so perhaps it is right about taking members to task for ignoring Get Out. But as a one who saw Stepford Wives in 1975 at age 14 and it is a film that for a female haunted my thoughts throughout the years, I was still quite able to say Chinatown was a way better film on all levels of film making. I would never have thought Stepford Wives was a great film though it resonated very much with me. Get Out is like Stepford Wives to which it owes a great debt. Its not on the same level of cinematic achievement as Shape of Water or Phantom Thread, though it resonates with many people.  I always ask myself when evaluating a film, is it a social flash in the pan or will I be watching it in 20 years. "

It is certainly possible, even likely, that the miserable (and temporary) little tax cuts for most Americans will be enough to keep the Republicans in a majority in both houses of Congress -- the desperate populace as a whole reliably votes for short-term economic dribbles, after all. So we must be prepared for this eventuality, and Charlie Savage is right to remind us of it. What will happen as a result, of course, is anyone's guess.","There are several weak points in this essay.<br/><br/>First, 1968 was a presidential election year; 2018 is not, so comparisons as to what the relative outcomes would produce are dubious at best.  Plus, I'd like to know why Mr. Savage says regarding 1968 that regardless of which way the election went there would be no immediate relief without specifying the relief.<br/><br/>Second, while voters are currently satisfied about the economy over 60% say the country is heading in the wrong direction.  This metric portends bad news for Republicans for two reasons: first, they can't rely on the economy to right-track the wrong track poll, that cake is baked.  Also, the electorate is not afraid of Democrat's controlling the economy because the economy was not in bad shape in 2016, except to the base voters of Trump and Sanders.<br/><br/>Third, when the media reports on Russian election meddling they are quick to say that while Russia meddled there is no evidence any votes were changed.  That is a very, very low threshold to set for evidence of russia's interference.<br/><br/>What about Russian voter suppression which could be done easily by changing a person's name in the data base?  It was reported the largest amount of meddling was in Democratic strongholds in toss up states like NC and even in red states like TX.<br/><br/>I would like to see a follow up essay that goes from ""What if"" to ""How?"""

Xi is now acting like Putin, to stay in power regardless of the cost and no matter what the term limits might be on paper. The West needs to see this threat. It has been coming for at least 50 years. The fact that Xi would stop any pretense of democracy is the surprising part of this. Not even lip service is given to democracy. Mr Trump is without knowledge of world political dynamics no matter what he might say or even believe. Maybe in three years or sooner we will have some one in office who will understand the challenges posed by China. It will not be too late, but the clock is ticking as we dawdle and are absorbed in the so called Russia collusion mania. We need to deal with real dangers: China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, and we need to deal with domestic problems: gun violence, infrastructure, health care, and immigration. "

After I saw it, I began to reflect on the other movies I had seen with all-black casts. I noticed that they all had one element in common: they were all about historical struggles with discrimination. Most were about slavery, like '12 Years a Slave' and others were about just plain mistreatment and racism, like 'Detroit.' While these movies are great and exist for the better, they focus on one part of black history rather than simply celebrating it in a depiction of strength and glory. 'Black Panther' was different. It was a pure, powerful depiction of what the black race truly is: capable and strong. Not only that, women were also portrayed very, very well in the movie. The women were strong and intelligent, with the main character's own sister being a technological genius. All of the women are portrayed as warriors, every bit as strong as their male partners. Some people may write 'Black Panther' off as just another superhero movie, but it is so, so much more than that. I only hope that the Academy's bias against superhero movies doesn't override 'Black Panther's' achievements and that it receives the recognition it deserves at next year's Oscars.

Wall street, however, is the complex, derivative trading mess that got us into the financial crisis.<br/><br/>The inherent problem is that your local credit union and JP Morgan have been constrained to the same rules that do not adequately measure for risk.  Unnecessary stress tests, living wills, and capital requirements have put undue hardship upon banks with less than 50 billion in assets.<br/><br/>This bill is designed in a bipartisan way to free up credit for rural banks, which will lead to more capital for consumers.

My brother (the patient's father) told me that he would get his family through the situation, but asked me to find the best neurosurgeon in the country for his daughter's condition.  I spent nearly two weeks flying around the country interviewing the best and brightest minds in neurosurgery.  I chose Dr. Wilson.  Although I had no training that would allow me to distinguish gradations of expertise, Dr. Wilson had a uniquely extraordinary demeanor that I had never seen in any other person.  I also felt that if the surgery went in an unexpected or sideways manner, Dr. Wilson would fight to save my niece as if it were his own child.  The operation went eight hours, and Dr. Wilson emerged from the OR with a broad smile.  He explained that the operation required more art than science, and that he had strategically and successfully clipped the aneurysm in five places.  He handed me a torn strip of scratch paper and said, ""Here are the serial numbers of the five clips; hold onto this for the rest of your niece's life in case she ever needs it.""  He was truly a larger-than-life heroic figure.  I'm sure that thousands of others have similar experiences to share.  My niece is now 38 and has never had a complication from her surgery.  "

A nationalist would not side with brutal foreign dictators and against American institutions and traditions. Nor does nationalism equal denial. Trump was not elected because he had a huge following, he was elected because Republicans willfully threw away every chance to stop him being nominated, and Democrats threw away every chance to avoid nominating the easiest opponent for him. <br/><br/>Fiscally irresponsible tax cuts for the rich are not patriotic or nationalistic, they are risky gambles on pandering to greed. Multiculturalism can be pro-nationalist, but not if it is based on blind political correctness, tokenism and tepidness. <br/><br/>Nationalism for America would mean reining in any military industrial complexes, and not turning the other cheek for decades towards the murderous imbecility of the NRA. It would include restoring basic factual American history and civics to public education, and combating mass ignorance of the nation's founding principles. It would include an understanding of the Constitution framers' structure of checks and balances, and their stern warnings about the sort of decrepit and dysfunctional two-party system cancer which has been rotting American politics and civil society for too many years.","This piece should be studied by every democratic candidate entering the upcoming elections.  The notion that all of us, despite many different backgrounds, are one ‚Äö√Ñ√∫nation‚Äö√Ñ√π seems so self-evident but our politicians do not embody this ideal; to the contrary, the dems are focused on dissecting each group into distinct political entities.

One very important part of this is the fact that there are so many black kids who have seen this movie and got to see themselves represented in such an amazing way; it is something that can be considered a step in the right direction.","Black Panther was a very good movie that I believe brought the black community back to our senses. The film showcases how my people came from royalty, but also shows that no one can tilt our crowns and we will do whatever we have to do to protect our people. Sometimes that is hard to say because we try to be in competition with each-other, we fight each-other, and kill our own people. So, I feel like this film showed our people that we don't have to kill each other to have that street name that people want, we don't have to be in competition with each-other, we need need to lift each-other up more in the black community. Black Panther really showcased on how much our people have actually built that people will never know or understand about. Even though Wakanda was a fantasy world it still show cased how intelligent our people are. For example, with T'Challa's little sister a young African lady working in the STEM field.

I advised my friend to try cognitive behavioral therapy, a non-drug, side-effect-free therapy that has been shown to be effective in many cases. Doctors have been brain-washed, and even paid by the pharmaceutical industry to place confidence in psychoactive drugs that often do more harm than good. Patient beware!"

Add to that the corporate crime wave, and you face a daunting task.

If you invest, you are complicit with a system that rewards only competition, greed, dishonesty, and one-upsmanship. Companies that aren't ruthless don't survive.  The ones that tart up their marketing successfully do.  You can analyze and nitpick details of how to invest within the system all you want, but to find a way to come out with a clean conscience can't be done.  Anybody who can follow a chain of causal analysis should be able to come to the greater conclusion.  And that is, Marx was right.  In a strange sense it doesn't matter anymore whether we value the higher good in our society (which we don't, except for a few outliers everyone disdains) because the consequences of our stupidity and selfishness will play out.  Though that is a damn shame, and it's a damn shame that we can't value something other than our own prevailing."

For example, the people there seem to either stay in their home city/town, or move to Moscow or St. Petersburg for work. With my point being that if a serious war ever breaks out, I believe that targeting only Moscow and St. Petersburg would be sufficient to collapse the entire country. Whereas in contrast, the United States has a diverse economy spread across a large number of large cities. So, even if Putin has ""super weapons"" that perhaps we do not, it would be completely idiotic to actually use them against us.<br/><br/>(3) Putin implying that our missile defense systems are ""useless"" is a hollow threat, since those systems weren't designed to stop a large-scale nuclear attack in the first place.

More demand for used metal could raise the return on steel and aluminum recycling.  Isn't that a good thing?<br/>If production increases wouldn't that be good for wages of steel mill workers?<br/>Higher wages for mill workers means more buying in the consumer economy.

And we all know that putting money in the hands of the poor means those dollars are put right back into the money pool where the wealth helps everyone.  So the Republicans do the opposite: tax cuts that companies simply use to buy back their own stock, hard-earned wealth lost to the economy.  These are business people with an eye on the bottom line?  Of course not.  These are unhinged narcissists trying to make the world over in their own image. Maybe they have a belief that they are God's instruments-why else would they have been born rich?  Some of them have glanced at the Bible and call themselves experts.  They have all reached a level of self-righteousness that permits no compromise.  And nothing that Trump does costs them personally.  So like remora eels on a shark, the GOP is going along for the ride as Trump destabiizes reality."

We moved her out of her apartment for all the reasons stated in the article. She was not taking good care of herself, and her neighbors were forced to intervene many times to take care of her animals and her. She called the ambulance when she didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t feel well and had repeated hospitalizations since she wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eating well or moving around much. She regarded to move into the assisted living facility as imprisonment and punishment, especially as she had to give up her animals (which were not being well cared for). Once there, she continued to isolate herself, refused to go to meals, and would not partake of any of the many activities offered. Eventually her health became precarious enough so that she moved into skilled nursing, where she now mainly lies in bed, reading, watching tv, and sporadically eating the pretty awful food. I often wonder whether we did the right thing to move her out of her apartment. Of course we had to, because she was neglecting herself. But even though we got her into care, it didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t stop the self-neglect. And by the way, she has consistently had psychiatric care throughout. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s just a tragedy, for her and her son, who has to watch this unfold. I think the person who wrote about self-loathing because of aging may have the real answer.

My mother used a chamber pot in the middle of the living room.  Neither of my parents wanted to die in a hospital, neither wanted their lives prolonged once their quality of life deteriorated.  Neither wanted to live with dementia.  Both were in their 90's and knew their conditions were irreversible.  Mom, who became deaf and lost her sense of taste, ate chocolate daily and watched old movies; dad drank vodka, quietly.  Later, we found many cases stashed around the house.  We could have taken either one and put them in assisted living, placed in front of a window or TV, visiting occasionally until they passed, but they had that and more, at their home.  I moved home and did the cooking and the errands.  Once my mother wanted to see our first house, so we took a road trip.

I start with cold water and stir with the tapered end of a cut off end piece of a broom handle over medium/medium low heat. Mr. Tanis cooks his polenta more than 45 minutes, because he uses  very low heat and doesn't stir the polenta continuously.

What I can go on, is accounts from people that I know- and trust me- I get a lot. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫When I was your age I had to do _______, nowadays we have ______:‚Äö√Ñ√π now this is something I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve probably heard a million times. And what I can gather from this, is that teenagers had a lot more responsibilities in the past, they had to take initiative of their lives at a far younger age and that was definitely harder. And that parents didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really have to worry about their kids as much as they do these day. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m often told that schools are far more competitive today than they used to be, that the workload has gotten worse, and college fees have gone up. So I think this generation of teens has had significantly more academic stress than previous generations. What I have come to believe is that being a teenager a few decades ago is, without a doubt, different. But I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s harder. Society will change, and with that change we will see evolutions in how we grow up- things will get easier and things will get harder- but parallels will always exists among the generations.",

From the creative ancient history of Wakanda, to how the civilization has grown over time with technologies the which we can only hope to achieve, this movie tells a great story through a great perspective. It is action packed, driven by an interesting and intriguing narrative of the role of the Black Panther, the king and protector of Wakanda and their relations with not only the tribes of their nation, but with the world around them as well. This movie is proud to possess a majorly black cast, from the protagonist, King T'Challa, played by Chadwick Boseman, to the main antagonist Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, along with many other characters making up the majority of the cast.<br/><br/>Although this movie has a cast composed many famous black actors, I don't think this movie is going to change anything. Sure, it boasts a cast comprised of a majority of America, but besides those actors who portrayed a comic book story, I don't understand how this leads to something different happening in our country. I think its a great thing that Marvel made this movie, but that's all it is, a movie. There are many other cinematic stories of struggles the black community has faced in America, and you don't hear about those movies being hailed as cinematic masterpieces, not so much so as Black Panther, from what I've seen.

That is the way of Trump to put nothing before his own interests.  That is why he is not involved in governing or leading...he is only interested in being the top story off the day.<br/>It is sad to see the fortunes of this country land in such weak and disingenuous hands.  At least by now a majority of us know the game and the gamesmanship.<br/>Ego is everything and the only thing in Trump's world.

Had virtually any other Democrat been the nominee of the party in 2016, Trump would not be in the White House now.  Yet it is hard to understand how so many Americans could be so gullible and stupid that they would vote for a man who was so vastly under qualified to be president compared to his opponent.  <br/><br/>If this country cannot bring itself to turn control of Congress over to Democrats in November after all we have witnessed over the last year, then this country is truly a sad country and deserves whatever incompetent leadership will bring it.  Midterm elections are notorious for producing low turnout.  This year should be a dramatic exception, and an overwhelming wave of voters should vote to throw Republicans out of office.

I found it interesting that some of my conservative friends whose opinions I have always valued did the same. For me the turning point was the amount of unvarnished hatred expressed by so many Democrats in these pages for anyone living in 'flyover country'. My own observation is that even in the 'pure Red' state of Oklahoma, where all of the counties have been Red in something like the last three elections, about a third of people still voted Democrat in the last election. The same attitude towards 'flyover country' resulted in the collapse of the 'Democratic firewall' and subsequently the loss of the election for Democrats. <br/><br/>A book I read awhile back was trying to express the attitude of some people. When asked what could be done to help someone that was struggling to make ends meet, the gentleman answered that a neighbor who was doing better had more cows than he had; could they kill some of the neighbors cows.

I had a girlfriend that let her breast cancer go due to lack of insurance and money until she was almost dead. <br/><br/>Now they are messing around with SNAP to starve the poorer population including the children and the elderly.<br/><br/>The Republicans are trying to make it a criminal offense to practice birth control (contraception) by allowing employers and churches to take it out of their medical insurance (Hobby Lobby) and teaching practical birth control methods that Planned Parenthood supports.  They are trying to take maternity care out of a lot of insurance, so we will have more Americans dying of childbirth complications due to no doctors, and no money.<br/><br/>This is nothing short of genocide against the Non-Rich.<br/><br/>Mr. Kristoff, you need to write about this also.","When I was a little girl reading the Diary of Anne Frank, I asked my mother ""How could this have happened?""

I believe that growing up in the 21st century is and will always be hard. The biggest problem that we face today are school shootings.

Porn that is done in a well-researched and thoughtful way surely could do the same with sexual behavior - it's all about what you show and what you don't show.<br/><br/>Of course porn can also be mindless entertainment, but so are many non-porn movies too.","It is an unavoidable fact that while pornography is not supposed to be a replacement for sex education, no amount of birds and bees explanations captures exactly what happens physically during sex, or why sex should even be considered desirable. Any young person who has listened to any intellectual explanation of sex will, upon viewing pornography for the first time, think, ""Oh ho, so that's what this is about!"" While it may not convey a feeling of caring or anything about real chemistry between people, the graphic   value of pornography goes way beyond the embarrassing explanations from parents or teachers in literally showing what physical sex is, which I don't think is a bad thing."

He has revealed we are polarized and not striving together as a nation toward a common goal. I see pockets of resistance and leadership springing up here and there.

We need to wake up as a country and produce some leaders or else it won't be four countries trying to figure out how to manipulate Jared Kushner, it will be every country with a vision trying to figure out how they can continue to play puppet Trump.

The series is not so much about Versace as it is about what led to his death and why he died.<br/><br/>I don't think Murphy's  intention was to focus on Versace any more than Shakespeare intended to focus on the character of Julius Caesar in ""The Tragedy of Julius Caesar."" Brutus is the central character, not Caesar, who dies less than halfway through the play. Cunanan does not exhibit the ennobling characteristics of the tragic hero because he has no self-knowledge. The reverse chronology intentionally makes it dramatically impossible to show such self-knowledge developing. <br/><br/>To add to Toni's point, Andrew sees life as a series of transactions for commodities. Only knowing Versace's public personae, he wrongly sees Versace as the embodiment of that world view. His mother's pride at being able to brag about Andrew, as well as Andrew's revelations and lies about his childhood, may suggest where this idea came from.  <br/><br/>Having hit bottom, Andrew cannot control his psychocultural mania. Unable to own Jeff and David, he kills them. He kills Miglin for the money and payback to Blanchard, etc. He kills the gardener for the truck.

I was touched because, knowing Williams, I realized how high Nakesha had soared before her tragic descent. <br/><br/>What many people may not realize about Williams is that for decades, US News has consistently rated it the top Liberal Arts college in the nation...the ""Harvard"" of small colleges, if you like.  It is extremely competitive (taking only a tiny percentage of highly qualified applicants) and expensive:  a year (with tuition, room and board), now costs $66,240.   The school takes only the ""best and the brightest"" and--one would ascertain from this story--the most caring.<br/><br/>The article raises the important question:  ""Should mentally-ill people be forced to receive treatment?'<br/><br/>After reading this sensitive and beautifully-written piece, I would say ""Yes!"" ","This is a tragic story and many of the earlier comments capture my thoughts and feelings about this lovely woman and her heartbreaking mental illness.<br/>I think we are wrong not to intervene.  Recently, I have read some very interesting articles coming out of Scandinavian countries which present new approaches for helping people manage their mental illness.  A key approach is<br/>for the psychiatrist to enter a partnership with the individual and help he/she learn the patterns of their illness, when they are losing clarity and the delusional thinking is coming into action.  Along with this approach, options of medications are considered.  I think this approach could be helpful because the individual is able to manage the illness and, potentially, can uphold dignity and responsibility.<br/>If people can learn skills to manage their illness, the concerns about housing, hygiene and general well-being can be addressed.  Unfortunately, so often, new concepts take a longish time for acceptance and utilization into the mainstream of a profession."

Trump has a way of seeing his way through divisions by exploiting them  for his advantage and then offering a compromise solution, e.g. his DACA proposal, which is up to the Democrats to accept or reject. They thus dug themselves in the same hole when they shut down the government. They then had to dig themselves out. The same is true of the North Korean narrative which the Democrats and the media have wishfully fashioned. Supposedly, we can't afford to have Trump with his finger on the nuclear button because he's too impulsive, a refrain which  Kim Jung Un is only too happy to echo. Brilliant. Has Trump pressed the button? The threats he has been making may not endear him to his critics, but his intended audience is not them but Kim Jung. So far it has worked. Now Kim is proposing talks with the US. Trump might very well jump at the chance if his goal was to placate his domestic critics, but Kim would only interpret that as a sign of weakness. The Democrats try to portray him as impulsive. They should be so impulsive. They then might have won the election.

There are simply some folks who cannot be helped to shelter and treatment short of physical restraint (which works for shelter, but is never a solution). I ran a church-based social service center in Chicago about 20 years ago. There were always the folks who, if gotten into a room by an agency, would in short order be back on the street. Many of them, like Nakesha, were paranoid. They simply felt safer on the streets because in housing they felt trapped and sure that sinister voices were coming out of the radiator or microwave etc. <br/><br/>There are many good hearted people in this story who did what they can. The question for society is, ""How do we respond as a society so that the care of these folks is more consistent and offers them the best life they can have, given their illness?"" <br/><br/>The only other answer is involuntary commitment to mental institutions, but that is never a good answer. Such places have often been worse for human beings than life on the streets. AND often once the patient is stabilized on medications they are released. Because the meds have nasty side-effects, they stop taking them, and again descend into psychosis and homelessness. "

The point about Rocky judging form the inside of the story, is that Rocky and Adrian belonged together and had real regard for each other. There was an obstacle. Adrain's sexual shyness , which was based on low self confidence. If Rocky hadn't have been Rocky he would have left Adrian to her loneliness and found a more relaxed partner. No story there. Shyness is an obstacle to love that has to be overcome. In the context of the movie, you can either try to overcome an obstacle to gain a great reward or you can leave well enough alone. Rocky could not beat Apollo Creed but he gave it his best shot. It was similar with Adrian. It would be great if the New York Times had some staff who were shy and sexually insecure.

I'm trying hard to understand and this was a help.  You gave me something for both parts of my brain.,"When it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s too warm, it because of global warming.  And when it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s too cold it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s because of global warming.<br/><br/>97% of climate scientists believe there is global warming, and that human activity is the dominant cause.  That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s strong evidence. But it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not conclusive proof. If a scientist is in the 3% he/she will be branded a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫denier‚Äö√Ñ√π by the media, the same word as in the phrase ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Holocaust denier,‚Äö√Ñ√π and he/she will have a very hard time getting published.  Far easier to join the crowd.  This is the psychology of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫pack science,‚Äö√Ñ√π which is similar to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫pack journalism.‚Äö√Ñ√π<br/><br/>Where I live, the dominant geological feature is the Great Lakes, which formed about 14,000 years ago, due to global warming, and the end of the last ice age. There was not much human activity 14,000 years ago.  Today, we again have global warming, and it seems to be occurring much faster than it did 14,000 years ago, and the explanation seems to be greenhouse gases from human activity. But let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s also remember, we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve only had accurate global temperature monitoring for 50 or 60 years, with satellites and accurate, worldwide, thermometers.<br/><br/>At this point, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m a believer, and I think we need to act accordingly. A root cause of human activity is population growth, perhaps it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s finally time to address this. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s certainly time to moderate our carbon footprint.<br/><br/>But, at the same time, let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s keep an open mind.  There have been many times when 97% of scientists got it wrong.  Who thinks the sun revolves around the earth?"

I find it too close to Nazi in my brain. However, I understand the need for pride to exist. It CAN exist on a broad plain to include all of us.","A person with liberal sentiments (tolerant, generous) can hardly espouse nationalism (the idea that states should represent groups formed on the basis of the characteristics of common birth -- physical ethnicity, language, and religion): it's not tolerant.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the political sentiment that historically is associated with parties called ""Liberal"" (replacement of the ancien regime -- monarchical, military, clerical -- with republican forms of government) has in many cases drawn on nationalism as an alternative to multi-national imperial territorial aggrandizement.<br/><br/>The U.S. was exceptional, however, in that it inherited political liberalism from post-Glorious Revolution England and was republican from birth.  Its unity was based on a geographic territory that it wanted to wrest from London's control, so no appeal to national distinction from England was needed (or possible).  Instead, the U.S. was a contractual association via a written Constitution.<br/><br/>U.S. white nationalism rejects this tradition.  As a minority movement, its best chance for success might be through a personality cult.  The best response for people of tolerant, generous sentiments might be to exalt the U.S. political tradition of Constitutionalism and the rule of law.  "

The courts and reactionary Republicans will strip us of our power every time they have the power, just like they always have.

Now it looks like the media is as wrong again today as they were about the 2016 election.  Schools are one of the softest targets out there with large gatherings of defenseless kids.   Social media is also part of the school shooting scene.  It glorifies the shooters and gives them a place to threaten with images of them holding guns.<br/>Semi- automatic hand guns and long guns have been around since WWI but the school shootings didn't start until Columbine in 1999.  Why with the availability of those weapons that nothing like that occurred for 50 years.  Society changed and ethics and honor went out the window.

There will always be extremes, but most of us are not. Thinking, caring conservatives can keep Democrats from socializing everything (roads, prisons, public schools, and health care, in my opinion, should not be for profit) and imposing burdens that are counterproductive. Democrats must keep reminding conservatives that no, no, you with your inherited wealth, your daddy's important contacts, and all that adoration or expectation shining in your parents' eyes, you didn't exactly get where you are by yourself and your employees do not live by bread alone. I still think that it's Bill Clinton's fault. He was so to the center to be practically a Republican himself and this seems to have driven Republicans far to the right in search an an identity. If Trump is where they've landed, I am sure those with a heart and a brain have much to resist and ponder."

The poorly funded paradigm shift from hospital to intensive home care is at the heart of this issue. Hospitals rely on untrained family members to provide complex care at a time when they need to work to support themselves.  Elderly spouses or frazzled parents of children with complex needs can't provide the care that our healthcare system demands of them.  Addiction and mental illness create huge problems for families and healthcare providers without much medical, legal, or ethical guidance.  Healthcare reform decisions to save money included sending patients home faster without funding a safety net or providing trained doctors and nurses.  Every complex care patient, young or old, should have a homecare referral prior to discharge from the hospital without placing the burden on stressed families to provide the care.  More families are refusing to sign discharge papers and take their loved ones home due to the physical and financial stress.  And I don't blame them. Time to design a healthcare system that provides medical and nursing supports in the home in collaboration with family members.  Additionally, standardized ethical/legal guidelines describing when a patient is no longer capable caring for themselves would help professional caregivers and family members.

Certainly not the Constitution.  According to them it was written by white men, slave owners who wrote the Bill of Rights to keep the black man on the plantations.  No!  America is not a nation worth getting national about.  America's history is one of racism and genocide.  Even the Declaration of Independence was penned by a white supremacist who owned slaves and used the slave women for his sex toys.<br/>Why are liberals even thinking about nationalism in America?  Call it a squatter's rights ism.  They have attempted to repudiate the very foundations of this country. Not even the elections are valid.  The Electoral system is flawed.  It was written to protect the plantations and keep the slaves down.  The second amendment was included to suppress slave rebellions.  American territory was stolen from the native tribes through genocide.","Mr. Mounk makes a compelling argument for liberals to work within the reality of how nation states define themselves within their respective borders and across the community of nations.  His proposal is sound.  However, in addition to liberals recognizing the indelible nature of national identity as a step toward a better patriotism, enough of us across political spectrums must acknowledge other realities.  In the United States, for example, the fact is that we have always been a racially interdependent society.  The problem has been with our national identify's failure to acknowledge it.  The United States could not have conceivably emerged with its global influence in less than a century had it not been for the contribution of its diverse populations, fundamentally its slaves whose labor was totally capitalized to their owners and to the world markets that consumed our exported commodities at costs discounted of wages.  Even the physical appearance of our population is evidence of our shared history long before any legal ruling sanctioning ""mixed-marriages.""  We have been integrated throughout our history, but we have yet to acknowledge the unjust terms of that integration let alone account for its essential role within our national identity.   Before the world can realize Mr. Mounk's vision, even Europe's identity, which ascended on the backs of other continents, must embrace its historic dependence on the very parts of the world whose populations they now reject.

He wanted to be in the army, he had talked to an Army recruiter at school just weeks ago, he was in the JROTC, a military recruiting program run and staffed by the military.  He was staying in a home whose head was a retired military man who had served in combat.  In 2002 all high schools are required to submit personal information on all of their students to the military for recruiting purposes.<br/>Someone should ask the military how many school shooters were targeted by recruiters.  Do you think they would answer that question truthfully?<br/>Cruz, like Adam Lanza, and other school shooters played combat themed video games obsessively, 12-15 hours a day.

Since then we have vigorously defended free and open trade for two reasons; first, the US emerged as the world's greatest industrial power after the war, so it was in our economic interest to promote open trade. Second, open trade tends to prevent another catastrophic world war. This is why the Marshall Plan demanded that Western Europe build closer economic ties.<br/><br/>Although the US has receded somewhat from its position as the world's leader in manufacturing, trade us not the zero-sum-game Trump makes it out to be. But more importantly, free trade promotes world peace and American democratic values.

Truly, what is in their minds that they cannot see that this man is, with their full support and aid, destroying our country and harming the world.  <br/><br/>May every single Republican be voted out of office this November.

I don't see any indication in this piece that these properties have any type of measure to determine compatibility of dorm mates. I'd personally be pretty upset if I was paying over $2,000 a month and getting potentially annoying/weird/unpleasant floor mates with whom I'd need to share a lounge space, kitchen, and bathroom. Is there any type of mediation measure available to the residents?  Any house rules in place?  Someone is bound to pee all over the toilet seat, cook smelly food, leave a mess in the kitchen, have a creepy boyfriend/girlfriend who hogs the couch and TV.

We were in training to become Marine Corps 2nd Lieutenants leading troops in Vietnam once we graduated from college in June 1968. I had my doubts about the war but I was still surprised that during the entire 10 week class the war itself was hardly discussed. No lectures from officers about stopping Communism or defending South Vietnam. Nothing about fighting for our country. Not even anything about upholding the honor of the Marine Corps.<br/><br/>The lieutenant in charge of our training platoon seemed never to leave his office. Rumor had it that he was against the war so that was why we never saw him. Our day-to-day training was conducted by two drill sergeants, one white and one black, both recently back from Vietnam. They did all the traditional hazing the Marine Corps is known for, although without any real malice or spirit. <br/><br/>They didn't mention the war except a couple of times when they wanted to emphasize the importance of learning what they were teaching us. They explained that if we didn't there was a good chance that when we got over to Nam our platoon would discover that what WE didn't know might get THEM killed. If that happened they might decide to roll a grenade into our tent one night so they could get someone who might know what he was doing. ""Fragging,""they called it. I think they were sincerely trying to be helpful. This was almost a year before the Tet Offensive. ","Professor Mark Moyar  and General H.R. McMaster have argued at length not too long ago that we could and should have won the war. Counterfactual history, a specialty of military intellectuals.  If only they had been in charge."

Although I obviously was not alive in previous centuries and therefore cannot compare personal experiences in each time period, I know for a fact that previous generations did not have the IPhones and social media platforms we have today. Many people argue the benefits of social media: being connected to distant friends and family, being caught up in world events, spreading positivity and protest, etc. However, the negative aspects of social media outweigh the positives for most teenagers growing up in the 21st century. Cyberbullying is a huge issue, and I have experienced it personally. In the past, if you we bullied, you would see the bully at school, but then you could retreat to the safety of your own home at the end of the day. Today, you are never safe from bullies thanks to social media. They can harass you through the phone even when you are at home. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had people prank call me, leave harassing text messages, post about me on Instagram and Snapchat, etc. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s torture. In earlier centuries, the technology for cyber bullying to take place on would not have existed and kids growing up back then would not have to deal with it. ","As time has gone on, people have found ways to make life easier. Technology advances in the past century, or so, have made communication faster and more efficient than ever before. Before cell phones there was writing letters that could take weeks to receive, and then came morse code, and Alexander Gram Bell‚Äö√Ñ√¥s first telephone, but just because there are so many inventions to make life easier it doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t necessarily mean that life is actually easier. I believe that growing up in the 21st century is harder than it was in the past. Bringing it back to technology; technology allows people to know everything that is going on in the world politically, economically, and socially. Newspapers have become electronic, so people can find out about news minutes after they happen. When something big happens, people like to post it on their facebook or instagram accounts, and even if we do not want anyone finding out about something word spreads fast thanks to texting. People today have no privacy. Technology exposes us all whether we realize it or not. Before technology people could be there own person, and not who the media made them out to be. When you would met someone for the first time, you couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t google their name and find out about their life, there were no previous expectations. The pressure people face today is extreme and unlike it has ever been before.  Pressures in school, pressures to be accepted by society both on and off of the media, and pressures to just simply succeed. "

This may be the new reality but needs to be used carefully and for the good and not the evil.<br/>It is already a problem that AI is not transparent and that we do not know why AI makes decisions it does after feeding it with lots of data. AI needs to be develop AI so that it can communicate why it does what does and also to be able to determine what foreign AI is doing. This is something that is difficult to do but if FakeApp can be used to change video without being able to determine that it was done we have given the machine independent processes that we cannot track. We should be scared of this, very scared until we can make AI transparent. "

Working in social services puts a person at the heart of human frailty -- we are all vulnerable, all fallible, and so many of us are one tragic loss, or illness, or a few paychecks away from the whole illusion of ""security"" crumbling. <br/><br/>I had grown up in comfortable, wealthy suburbs.  The clear impression I was left with after those burnout years at the shelters was that the variety of homeless people I met were so very much like the variety of people in my home town. There were unlucky people, optimistic types, charmers, mentally ill people, substance abusers, angels, and mean folks in my home town. Same with the shelters -- only difference was the people in the shelters no longer, or never had, a safety net. Their families weren't rich to begin with. They ran out of friends to stay with. They lost their jobs. Some lost their children. Every winter, some lost their lives. But they weren't that different. They really weren't any different from me."

Americans will do that but mostly in their own small group, their town or church. Canada being a notable exception, perhaps due to their French/English dual heritage.

It is a clear corruption of the concept of one person one vote, but the courts have upheld it and the Democrats have acted like it is some kind of sacred cow.  So why not give greater weight to the voters within families with more children?  At least their children are citizens.","Given the number of cadavers who have long been rumored to vote in places such as Cook County, Illinois, surely this proposal isn't that much of a philosophical stretch, albeit a stiff challenge to ever implement.<br/>Conservatives would likely cry, ""over my dead body,"" as the suggestion certainly flies in the face of their efforts to reduce, rather than increase the roster of eligible voters, diminishing the likelihood of it become reality. <br/><br/>One could, on a more serious note, hang a hat on the notion that not allowing sixteen year olds to vote amounts to taxation without representation, as many of them work and pay taxes, but can't cast a ballot. <br/><br/>Far more irresponsible than mid-teens who, it should be noted, are much better informed than earlier generations thanks to social media, are those adults who, having the right to vote, routinely fail to exercise it at all. Perhaps a system, like Australia's, where non-voters are penalized, would be a step in the right direction, and could account for significant increases in voter participation."

My mother is an extreme hoarder whose behavior put my father's heath and safety in jeopardy, but when my sister and I went to APS to report her, we were told that they were overwhelmed and had no real services to provide.  I like Texas' approach here re: mandatory reporting required of EVERYONE.  Since my father's passing, my mother changed the locks on her house to keep me out and she clings to my brothers, who take turns either ignoring her or actively enabling her hoarding.  This article implies that there are people at the ready to intervene (if only they weren't conflicted about issues of self-determination), but that's not my experience.  This article is right that there is significant reluctance among families about reporting conditions, not always because they fear unpleasant/unhelpful disruption (sometimes it's just embarrassment).  I reported my mother to everyone I could think of (the town, social workers caring for my dad, her doctor, APS), and apart from gasps and shocked reaction when they saw photos, it accomplished nothing.  Problem acknowledged, no intervention offered.  I do believe that family members should feel pressure to report, whether or not intervention is possible.  It's the right thing to do."

Many will run like rats when this administration's ship sinks and swim onto the decks of other hulks of cupidity and avarice. ",AARP has about 40 million members and couldn't drive the outcome of health care debate.  The NRA has around 4.5 million members.<br/>How is that this one organization with an order of magnitude less members can hold the entire country hostage to their policy agenda - of guns begat guns.  And get special 1-1 meetings with the president so he can do another spineless flip-flop.<br/>The only way to drive this is for each voter who wants to change gun laws to tell their elected officials - you take a single dollar of NRA money you won't get my vote. Period.

I find their love and humanity uplifting and affirming.  Thank you to all of them.","Nakesha‚Äö√Ñ√¥s story moved me. My brother has paranoid schizophrenia, and he has been homeless sporadically over the years, bouncing around among family members and taking off unexpectedly, sometimes ending up in jail for low-level ‚Äö√Ñ√∫crimes‚Äö√Ñ√π like trespass. It is devastating for all those affected. <br/><br/>It took years for him to accept his diagnosis and medication as part of his treatment. Without his involuntary short-term admission to an inpatient mental health center, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not sure it ever would have happened. After a decade of tragedy and what often seemed like futile efforts, he is no longer homeless. Thanks to sound public policy decisions in Minnesota, Matthew is on medication, has an apartment, and through Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams funded by the state, he has multiple weekly home visits from nurses and social workers. They help him navigate many of the challenges he faces. They monitor his medication and schedule doctor and therapy appointments proactively. Notably, when he has rough periods‚Äö√Ñ√Æan inevitable feature of mental illness‚Äö√Ñ√Æthey are able to address it before it becomes a full-blown crisis. The worry, stress, and sense of utter helplessness we used to feel has given way to gratefulness for this program and the people who do its work.<br/><br/>These challenges seem intractable, and for a long time I thought they were. They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re not. What they require is a commitment to more compassionate, thoughtful public policies that treat homeless people as whole people. "

The big guys think they're size insulates them from those same best practices that keep the midsized banks safe from the mistakes every lend eventually makes in evaluating risk.  Hence the capital cushion that needs to be there to carry the institution through the rough weather that always comes.  This is also why Glass Steagall should be restored. It forced specialists to stay specialized.  Mortgage lenders do mortgages; investment banks play a very high stakes game and if they treat mortgages that way you get subprime loans painted to look like triple A assets.  Because mortgages are boring bulk products and originating them is factory work.  Just that yields on subprime real estate loans got to be too attractive.  Made 'em look like something a venture capitalist should play with.  ,"There's a world of difference between custodial services which are short in duration per transaction, and mortgage backed securities, whose durations are exponentially longer being in essence driven by pools of mortgages tied by coupon rate to securities.  The former can be easily monitored and managed.  The latter depends on scrupulous valuations of portfolio worth which can only be done by sampling and inspection of the pools in question.  Used to perform this for Citi when that company was purchasing mortgage servicing and we were performing the loan quality assurance necessary to value a servicing contract.  This should be done as a matter of course in the setting the value of securities based on credit quality.  That this didn't happen in the '08 period is how the collapse was triggered. Basically by fraudulent sale of securities that were deliberately overvalued and priced as quality paper when it was anything but."

Donald Trump is not a legitimate president. This is not a real presidency in any historical sense so attempting to compare it to past presidencies is futile.  His election victory was so tainted in so many ways that it cannot possibly be said to represent the will of the nation's voters.  He has never established an actual stable presidential administration to deal with governing the country but rather has turned the executive branch into a family run criminal enterprise bent on self promotion and self enrichment. He has left policy to congressional Republicans while his rogue's  gallery of appointees has set about corrupting or destroying the agencies they were hired to administer.  He has systematically offended our allies and praised our adversaries.  His attempts at involvement in policy decisions have been disruptive at best and display his towering ignorance.  He has intentionally left us vulnerable to ongoing cyber attacks by Russia and has conspired with congressional republicans to obstruct investigation into past Russian election interference and his campaign's involvement in same.  In the absence of effective checks on Trump, the so called ""deep state"" may be the only thing saving the nation from disaster. Nevertheless a lot of bad things can happen in the next three years."

Dismantling government agencies is one thing but wreaking havoc on the world economy is quite another. Acting upon the ridiculous sound bites amplified by Fox News that resonated with some very ignorant members of his base has become the basis of his new world disorder.<br/>I continue to pray to Mueller every night...,"Trump in his infinite stupidity, has just announced that if Europe places import tariffs on our goods, he will place tariffs on their cars.  Europe has done nothing yet, and Trump is threatening massive retaliation.  So what's going to happen when trade sanctions are actually made in retaliation?  That maniac is on the verge of starting a real trade war.   The kind that results in global recessions.  <br/><br/>I operate a small cottage industry manufacturing concern.  Last year, my income was cut in half because of Trump.  About half of sales go overseas. Last year, those dropped by at least 75%.  As of Feb. sales have rebounded strongly and most all of those were for export.  My European and Asian customers started buying again.  If he starts a trade war, that business will certainly dry up.  <br/><br/>I have parts made for me out of aluminum.  Those have been rising in cost anyway.  Understand this.  The 10% tariff is much higher when the product hits the customer.  Here is how it works.<br/><br/>Let's say my fabricator's material costs rise 10%.  He will then raise his prices by 20% because he can't eat the cost of tying up more money in inventory.  All fabricators use a multiplier based on raw costs.  When I buy the part, I have to add in my multiplier for the same reasons.  If there were a retailer in the chain, they would do the same.  <br/><br/>The tariffs are then highly inflationary which will trigger higher interest rates.<br/>We will end up with both inflation and a global recession.  MAGA! "

At least that was how I experienced it when I saw it as a teenager in 1980--but it's entirely possible that I was mistaking my own outrage for the film's point of view. ","Fifty Shades of Gray--book and film made overwhelmingly popular (I. E. Purchased) by women. Please explain how this fits in to your thesis. Women do want to be carried off--as long as they get to choose the Rhett, Heathcliff, or Rocky."

The income from the brought asset will trickle in to the new owners.<br/><br/>Now about those stock buybacks and those raised dividends.  With a buyback, your stock investment goes up not because the company is making more money but because there is less stock out there.  So investors sell juiced stock and that profit is taxed at capital gain rate which is a rate less than your paycheck rate.  Higher dividends? Taxed at the capital gain rate. And! No pesky payroll taxes on dividends or stock sales.  You see where this tax cut is trickling to: me and Warren.<br/><br/>And one more. We now have a whole new tax loophole structure.

They learn about their relationship with food by watching their parents. They need to eat with and see their parents or caregivers eating a wide variety of healthy foods with enthusiasm &amp; a positive attitude.  This is how babies learn to adopt healthy eating habits. Childhood obesity often starts with a distorted relationship with food. Baby-led feeding works in theory, but only if the parents have some confidence and knowledge of what to offer a baby &amp; how. Some well meaning new parents may use food to get their babies to sleep more and this can morph into a habit that's hard to break. I have raised 2 children who are normal weight adults. They ate enthusiastically as kids. And so did their father and I. I am a registered dietitian and worked in a WIC program. I also counseled outpatients - many for weight loss, including children and teens. A few conclusions: Eat with your kids and mirror healthy eating habits. Make family mealtime a priority (and fun), especially with younger children. This is so important!  Be positive about food and don't use one food as a bribe for another one.  Parents can only control what a child is given to eat at a meal. A young toddler needs a child size fork and spoon - patiently show her how to use it every time and leave her be. Forget the ""clean plate club."" Don't use food as a reward or substitute for love &amp; attention. Childhood obesity is a serious lifelong health risk. Let's prioritize prevention.",

The data produced during the experiment must be examined in order to reach a conclusion.  The experiment must be able to produce consistent results to have value to the scientific community.  Scientists use these conclusions to spawn new research. If the data shows a methodology to be flawed it will be instructive in the sense that it would require a new hypothesis or it will be discarded as failed.

It was leaked to syndicated columnist Jack Anderson.  Powell considered the American economic system to be under attack from socialist and communists.

If you agree to allow a worker to opt out of union membership, why not allow unions to not represent them? If union membership were truly voluntary, workers who found value in membership, I.e. collective bargaining, would gladly pay the agency fee.

But there are three problems with that statement.  The first is that there is no mention of time.  Free markets may tend toward efficient, but they are neither fast, nor kind.  It takes time for a market economy to shift investment, retool, retrain and relocate.  Change is very disruptive.<br/><br/>The second is the word 'Free.'  Tax policy, government regulation (and no, regulation is not always bad) outlook, purity of consumer choice and stability all combine to distort the effect of free.  Medical care is not dictated by the free market as the life or death choice tends to seriously skew elasticity.<br/><br/>The third problem us that markets tend to be driven by players maximizing their own benefits.  A free market tends NOT to maximize total benefit.  Econ 101 illustrations like the 'Tragety of the Commons"" and the group interest rate excercise, show the fallacy of believing markets maximize the group good.<br/><br/>So in the case of Steel, we have just removed some freedom from the market.  In the long term an efficient market would pull investment from less attractive sources. Wages and jobs would in crease in the steel industry.  Workers would migrate to the jobs, aquiring the training as needed.

Duvernay had no qualms recreating LBJ as a neo-racist, falsely claiming that he essentially sided with the racist politicians in the south to undermine MLK and the civil rights movement.  Am I supposed to believe that she will craft a film based on L'Engle's vision, rather than simple replace the film's central message with one more in tune with her race centric viewpoint?  I hope I'm wrong, but will not be surprised if it ends up like all so many other Hollywood adaptations..see ""the cat in the hat.' "

Facts - not needed when you want to ignore Russian attacked on our country. Income inequality - don't even let me get started. Morality of evangelicals - total hypocrisy in voting for Donald Trump. Progressives will win because they are better stewards of our country, our democracy, our economy and our culture. A culture that respects a women's freedom to choose. A society that allows people to protect their children from the mentally ill killing them with military weapons that are only sold so a few can make enormous profits and then bribe Republicans all too eager to take their money. That is why we should win, but of course voting makes all the difference. We will see in November.","When declaring a 'war', it is good to understand who is doing the dying and why.<br/><br/>From my limited viewpoint, I see students of all ages dying in schools and universities, I see young and old alike dying from lack of medical access, and I see avenues of despair leading to death by opioids.  <br/><br/>Not that those dying believe in dying from lack of safety, or lack of care, or find their higher calling in an overdose; they die because those in power have codified bearing arms as a God given right or legislated poverty as a moral defect.<br/><br/>A 'war' obligating a group to die for beliefs they do not hold soon stops being a war and becomes a revolution."

There is a lot of age discrimination out there. They ask you ""how long do you plan on being here, when did you graduate high school?"" It is not that easy to stay employed until you are 70. Companies did away with pensions and that was a mistake. They should have made a pension contributory. Companies use the excuse of ""downsizing"" to get rid of employees. Then they give you a spreadsheet with various ages, that were terminated, so you cannot sue them for age discrimination.  It is all about share holder value. They feel that once you get past 50 you are no longer valuable. And they don't often contribute to the 401K. It is up to the employer, if they had a ""good year"".

The movies cited may have occurred in the relatively recent past when women were expected to submit without protest.  Going farther back, in feudal times, the male nobility who owned the land and the serfs, had free access to women.  It was known as the ""droit du Seigneur,"" or the right of the lord (i.e., nobleman).  For example, when serfs or peasants married, the lord of the manor was expected to exercise his right to initiate the wife in her marital duties.  Barbaric by our standards, no doubt.  But in a classist society, such differences in power were the way things worked.  Such powers extended to the owners of slaves in the US and elsewhere, where the owner had access to the females when, where and how he  pleased.  Brutal and animalistic along with being an abuse of power, that was how things worked.  By our current standards, the structure of the society was illegitimate, as were many of the children produced by such forced encounters.  So it is logical that successful men, even in more democratic societies, believed they had a right to exercise their power as males over females.  Again, repugnant and abusive, yes.  But historical fact nonetheless.  Movie plots showing men abusing their power with women reflect the mores of the times in which they are set. I recall a 1977 movie with John Denver and George Burns.  John was very loving with his wife.","Regarding Lady Bird: it was the most boring and cliche ridden movie I've seen in a lifetime of movie going, and I'm no spring chicken.  <br/><br/>Regarding Gone With the Wind, the Sheik, and bodice rippers (not to mention  100 years of soap operas, Twilight and every vampire movie): their main audience is woman, and while I won't say ""that's want they want"", I still have always been bewildered at their attraction to these type of genres.

However, when he asserts that ""the case for worrying about trade deficits, like the case for running budget deficits, has largely evaporated now that unemployment is back to 4 percent.""  Economic prosperity is obviously not measured just by the single statistic of how many citizens are employed.  A worker at a fast food chain and one at a unionized factory making multiple times more per hour both count as 1 person employed. Because of decades of administrations, Republican and Democrat, proving mostly feckless in addressing rampant unfair trade practices engaged in by nations running ever growing trade imbalances with us--with China being the worst offender--millions of good, well-paid jobs available to non-college educated workers disappeared. The backlash in 2016 against the obliviousness to this by politicians and economic pundits is a key reason we now have one of the worst presidents ever in the Oval Office.<br/><br/>Yes, Trump acted like a bull in a china shop (puns intended) with his bellicose blather about trade wars being good.

","The fight to reclaim the brains of the people below the age of 45 will be very difficult. The re-wiring of their brains started by watching video games and has grown exponentially with the advent of smartphones. While in Orlando a few years ago, there was a family eating next to me. There were 2 young parents perhaps below the age of 30 and their 2 young children probably about 3 and 5 years old. The parents had their heads buried in their smartphones playing video games while their children were pulling on their parent's sleeves vying for their attention. The parents were so engrossed in their video games, that they totally ignored their kid's pleas for over 20 minutes. The chance that this family will learn to behave within proper social decorum seems bleak. Unfortunately for that family, they will most likely turn out dysfunctional, lacking the emotional ties that families need. How does society even begin to deal with the millions of families just like this one? Our species is on the decline because of the mind addicting attributes of these screens and apps."

This man may be the only person standing in the way of a Constitutional crisis, the magnitude of which this country has never seen. I'm in my sixties, and I know that this current administration is far more corrupt and dangerous than was the Nixon administration. With his relentless shredding of our democracy and our once fine country, Trump is literally only limited by his imagination and the laws of physics. The damage he's already caused in his first year is staggering.<br/><br/>So understand this. If Jeff Sessions is the only person standing in the way of Trump entirely destroying our country, we are indeed on very shaky ground.","Although I disagree vehemently with decisions that Mr. Sessions made regarding DOJ's enforcement policies, must agree with these authors.  I also watched his confirmation hearings, in which he displayed a sound knowledge of Constitutional law, and in which he promised that his ties to Trump's candidacy would not interfere with his duty to represent the American people. He may be in the process of redeeming himself. And, by the way, he only had to recuse himself from the special counsle's investigation because he was potentially a witness/party.  He is certainly free to examine whatever shenanigans might be going on in the executive branch now. "

When I saw the headline I thought we were in for a Marxist critique (i.e. capitalism cannot be reconciled with a social conscience).  But seriously, it's hard to invest even without considering one's social conscience (if one cares to do so while investing), and shortcuts to personal investing, like assigning responsibility to another person or a robot, may make it easier, but they don't make it better.  Why should ESG or SRI be any different?  If you're separated from these ""bad"" companies by a robot and an index ETF, how much ""ownership of evil"" is really on you?  Or is this just feel-good?  Hey, it's your money.","Thanks Mr Lieber for the most useful NY Times articles I have encountered in over 25 years of readership!

Kids not doing things they need to do because they are on social media should have to hand over their phones when they get to class or come in the front door.<br/><br/>We can start simply and carry books and crayons and small toys to keep the smaller ones entertained rather than just handing over the phone.

Chavez stripped an entire professional class from the country's institutions and places of business and hand-delivered them to his band of wealthy socialist cronies. Now in 2018 they will bear the fruits of 20 years of crony socialism. It appears the author took the reported statistics (and the sources at of Chavez's popularity) at face value. ","Chavez arose on the backs of an ignorant populace. Like Spain during colonial times, successive leaders neglected the real education of the people. Thus they weren't able to detect deceit where it appeared clearly in Chavez, an ignorant demagogue with political savvy. This is still the case.

Venezuelans have not really known socialism, though many (the majority??) think they have.<br/><br/>The Venezuelan wars of independence from Spain led by Bolivar, Cristobal Mendoza, and many others, were not supported by ""the people."" Ordinary people in Venezuela preferred submission to the King than freedom and self-government. Only when the Revolution had triumphed did ""the people"" see the inevitable change and embraced it. And then they turned against their very liberators: Bolivar died penniless, nearly alone, reviled, and consumptive somewhere in Colombia. <br/><br/>Educated Venezuelans like L‚àö‚â•pez sit in jail, and Yale educated economist Henrique Salas R‚àö‚àÇmer, who lost the 1998 election to Chavez by a very small margin, sits exiled in the U.

David Brooks covered a lot of topics that worry me such as,""We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re the school shooting generation,‚Äö√Ñ√π one Harvard student told me. Another said: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Wall Street tanked the country and no one got punished. The same with government.‚Äö√Ñ√π These are college students making these comments, they are realizing that the world is a mean corrupted place that their parents in a way have created. One thing I David Brooks failed to mention that I feel is an extreme problem is social media. Social media has brought many people to fame and ruined many more. You say one racist, antisemitic, or hateful comment on social media and you're done; bye scholarship, bye friends, bye social life. Growing up now has a lot more risk than it did in the past. ","I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think this is a question of which generation has it worse. Each generation has its own problems, its own struggles. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫school shooting generation‚Äö√Ñ√π, we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re the #MeToo movement, we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re Black Lives Matter. We join forces to fight for or against something through rallys and social media, but not in everyday life. This is where we become separated. That is the down fall of this generation. One student said, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re more connected but we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re more apart,‚Äö√Ñ√π and this is so immensely true.<br/><br/>I believe the issue of the era is the people of this generation. This generation is fake. We have fake friends who say fake things about their fake opinions. It ends up hurting us. One day we will be ‚Äö√Ñ√∫spreading the word to end the word‚Äö√Ñ√π and the next using ‚Äö√Ñ√∫the word‚Äö√Ñ√π. We cancel ourselves out. We start many great movements and the reason they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t go far is because we don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t let them. We either take things too far or not far enough.<br/><br/>One student said, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫You come to realize the U.S. is this incredibly imperfect place.‚Äö√Ñ√π Never in my life have I been told that the U.S. was perfect. Turn on the news and you find that out real quick. We are ‚Äö√Ñ√∫A Generation Emerging From the Wreckage‚Äö√Ñ√π which we made.

While I may not be able to speak on behalf of black people, since I am white, I still find it silly that this is the standard required for a ""civil rights breakthrough"". On another note, I do not understand why we need a civil rights breakthrough if blacks are already held to the same legal standard as everyone else, and have the same rights as anyone else. While racism is still practiced by every group (whites aren't the only people who can be racist, and ""reverse racism"" is just racism) it has nothing to do with public policy, but rather the attitude of certain members of our populace. People should be more educated about the statements they make, and calling a superhero movie an example of a major civil rights breakthrough on the level of Martin Luther King Jr.'s movement or the election of Barack Obama is not an example of a well researched and intelligent statement. ","I went to see Black Panther opening night and was not disappointed. The theater I usually go to is never crowded opening night, no matter the movie. This time it was packed, which didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t surprise me at all considering the hype this movie has had for so long. As I stated in the last Black Panther article, Marvel does it again and hits this one out of the park. <br/><br/>    Although this movie will go down in history as an amazing marvel movie, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think that this is a defining moment in U.S. history. There have been plenty of other black central movies and other black superheroes. Yes this is the first standalone black superhero movie I do not think that it will change the United States in ways people think. For example, Black Panther was created in 1966 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. This was a time of segregation and a lot of racism, and for two white comic book writers to go and create a black superhero in this time is very memorable so you would think that it was a big impact. But it wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t in the way they thought it would be, more black superheroes were created, that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s all. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the same for the Black Panther movie, although there is no segregation and not nearly as much racism going on now. I think that this will just encourage Marvel to create more black superhero standalone movies. "

The lack of trust can nip good in the very bud.  But how do we strike a balance between letting evil run roughshod and assuming the best from people first?<br/><br/>Although I've been away from my religious faith for a long time, I remember this, and I hope you can see the profundity of it: ""Love beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.""  To embody that love is better than a gun, but you need faith for it, maybe not religious faith, but faith nonetheless."

As some here have said interest rates and commodity prices rise everywhere.  This includes everything the government buys  such as military goods and the price of infrastructure repair.  The cost of financing our debt will also rise.  So who will pay this extra cost?  taxpayers of course and those dependent on government services who will see those services evaporate.  Unexpected consequences will appear everywhere including on those getting a temporary wind fall. <br/><br/>If you want to change how we do business with those who seem to be dumping cheap products into our economy, we must look carefully at the things they buy from us and negotiate the balance of trade.  A tariff is a very heavy handed tool to use indiscriminately and in the hands of a fool like our president it can be devastating.","Consumers have benefitted greatly from cheap foreign goods.  Walmart became a juggernaut with Chinese made products.  Trade protection has been muted by companies that do major sales overseas like Boeing.  Steel is essential to many expensive finished products and for ubiquitous cheap items such as cans.  Steel is a commodity that is taken deadly seriously and many of the USs trading partners will not sit idly by while the US raises tariffs.  Free trade was great for the British empire and for the US after WW2 but now the US is no longer the producer that it was.  Predatory trade practices by China and S Korea have helped domestic sales in the US.  China has taken a preeminent position in trade in the great off shoring debacle in the late 80s. What once was seen as a way for capital to win over labor now is an issue that Trump wants to revisit with tariffs.  Now Trump has tried, with marginal success, to tap into a sea of discontent and xenophobia for the loss of US jobs that probably won't return.  Especially with the technological revolution that has taken place by industrial producers.  Consumers will see rising prices which free traders call a tax imposed because of tariffs."

I know from discussions wth several of my friends that a lot of women of my generation bought into the idea that if you were the right kind of woman a man would change for you. The movie ""Pillowtalk"" was all about that concept. Rock Hudson, a terrible womanizer, is ""domesticated"" when he meets the right woman, played by Doris Day.  By the end of the movie he is shown all in a twitter over the birth of their child. That was a very dangerous message which implicitly challenged us to be good enough women to tame a playboy and implicitly put the blame on us he continued in his bad boy ways. (I wonder if Melania ever watched ""Pillow Talk""........)<br/>The other destructive message I clearly remember is that it is normal for men to have cold feet about marriage so if it feels like your fianc‚àö¬© to is pulling back, don't worry. All guys are like that and things will be OK.<br/>These kinds of messages can have a big impact on what young people think is acceptable behavior. Sure, they may not have that effect on older people but by then it is often too late for to avoid acting on those misleading messages. The truth is that if you want a serious relationship stay away from a guy who is a player and if your fianc‚àö¬© is getting cold feet take it seriously. Very seriously. That may not make for great movies but it is good advice. "

The prayer asks us to accept that things like death are a necessary part of the creation process that also brings us all the good things in life.  God set in motion a process of creation that includes both rules (e.g. the laws of physics) and randomness (the particles of the universe bump into each other in random ways).  The rules allow the physical world to exist, the randomness allows for the evolution of the universe towards the remarkable diversity and beauty that the universe contains.  We cannot have the beauty without ""collisions"" that also cause change (including death).  Many prayers ask us to submit to the inherent tension between the wonder of life and the changes in ourselves and other creatures that lead us to death.  When we can praise God at a time of loss or impending loss, we are bringing ourselves to an acceptance of that inherent conflict and opening ourselves to be able to have joy in the wonderful things in life.

Had Donald Trump used the $1.5 trillion he gave away to corporations and the 1 percent as investment in rebuilding infrastructure like bridges and water systems there would have been good construction jobs in these communities, good jobs making steel, hauling steel, and fabricating construction equipment. In turn that would mean jobs in restaurants and stores and services. But Trump was eager to channel that $1.5 trillion to people at the top, so for every $1 in bonuses or wages to workers companies have been allocating $34 to stock buybacks and other benefits for shareholders and executives. Remember that many shareholders are foreigners so hundreds of billions of dollars leave the country to further enrich Arab princes, German and Canadian pension funds, Swiss bankers, and wealthy Chinese executives instead of employing workers in Burgettstown and Mt.

The hard left asks the right questions but its offered answers are profoundly unhelpful or worse.  They offer no real way forward in the real world we live in.

It worked.  Europe and Asia recovered, and Latin America is now democratic an becoming more prosperous each year (with some obvious exceptions).

Young girls, in particular, are very hard on their appearance and how they look. Being overworked and concerned about one's body image has become a very prevalent issue.

","Overall, I think that growing up in the 21st century is harder than it ever was. For example, school curriculum is becoming more and more difficult. Getting into colleges is more competitive than ever. We are bombarded with more and more things to worry about each day. Another thing is that bullying is more prevalent nowadays. It is much easier to cyberbully now. Hiding behind a screen and making fun of someone is easier than saying the same things to their face. We are always worried that we will be next."

The 1991 red Burgundies weren't getting much love coming on the heels of of the highly touted (and rightfully so) 1990s. I attended a tasting of 35 or so wines that were from good producers, most at the village level and some premier cru. I remember thinking, ""These wines are so different from 1990, and certainly lean by comparison."" But they had excellent acidity and I felt that some time in the bottle would allow them to flesh out a bit. Best of all, they were priced at a 20 - 25 % discount to the 1990s. So I stocked up! And over the next few years, they came together beautifully. As you and commenters on the 2013 Bordeaux emphasize, wines with those profiles are at their best with food.

There are many emerging national problems in today's society, such as the school shootings. Although there are certain aspects of the 21st century that make it an easier time to grow up in, for instance, advanced technology, there are also ever-increasing threats to society. When I have spoken with my parents about their childhood, they agree that it is harder to grow up in the 21st century than it was in the past. They were able to enjoy life more freely without having to worry about the problems of their surroundings.  ","Being a first generation American, I have always been told by my family that I am lucky to be in a country where I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have to deal with poverty. Having had to walk about 5 miles each day to collect drinking water, my family made it their goal to not have their children deal with the same things as them. That being said, while I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have to face the harsh reality of poverty, I do have to deal with other things that have been occurring. The 21st century has allowed for things such as rape, kidnapping, police brutality, and more to continue on and take shape in our country. We fear being away from a phone screen that we do not realise how much danger we put ourselves in. Before, children were innocent. They could go out of their houses and not have a care in the world. They didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know if the dangers that surrounded them. Now, some kids use these troublesome realities as an excuse to stay home. Technology wise, our generation has the upper-hand. But as many know, technology is like a double-edged sword. It allows from criminals to have easy access to targeting minors. This is one of the main reasons I believe that it is somewhat harder to grow up in the 21st century than in the past. "

Being a Black American in the US you grow up not really knowing where you come from. All you know is that your ancestors were considered 60 percent of a person and always had to change themselves to be accepted. Black Panther is celebrating what black people have been shamed for for many years, and now in a time where the BLM movement and Black Excellence is so widespread, it gives black people a sense of pride and a sense of belonging, like we are more connected to our roots. Having an all black cast where everyone is powerful, makes brown boys and girls feel like they can be powerful too. Even though other people might just see this as ‚Äö√Ñ√≤another superhero movie,‚Äö√Ñ√¥ I think it has sparked and will spark more conversation among black people, and forever be something we were glad we got to live through and see.","Black Panther was shown to a generation that truly needed it. Today in America we are at a point of such racial violence that people are scared of breathing because of their skin color. The Black Panther was created to give black children someone to look up to, their own Captain America. The movie showed a different side to the black men and women we commonly see on the screens. The men were shown as powerful and wise, not some drug dealing thug on the corner. The women were seen as strong and loyal to their country instead of just somebody's baby mama.

","When Jay points out that there is a gap between our devotion to practice, and the literal meaning of the practice, I think he's making a great point about the force of liturgy and ritual.<br/><br/>However, its sad that Jay doesn't think he can believe the prayer. Because prayer is even more powerful when we do believe the things we say. <br/><br/>More than that, I think the author misses the point of the phrase ""in the world which he created according to his will,"" when he writes:<br/>"" Whatever its origins, the text of the prayer leaves me cold. Each day as I say the Kaddish, I struggle with the fact that I am praising a God who, according to Jewish tradition, created the world ‚Äö√Ñ√∫according to His Will.‚Äö√Ñ√π Does God really will that the world endure the cruelty and suffering we see so often?""<br/><br/>He seems to think that the Kaddish indicates that God is happy with the world as it is. That's actually the opposite point of the Kaddish. The immediately following phrase says, ""May he establish his kingdom in our lifetime and in our days."" The idea of ‚óä√ª‚óä√∫‚óä√µ‚óä√Ø‚óä‚Ñ¢ ‚óä¬©‚óä√ª‚óä√¥‚óä√π ""the kingdom of God,"" is a vision of a transformed world in which things finally are as they should be.<br/>So, if/when our encounter with death or with dehumanizing diseases like Alzheimers (which is particularly harsh for the family members), prompt us to conquer those diseases, or improve the human condition, then we are actually advancing ‚óä√ª‚óä√∫‚óä√µ‚óä√Ø‚óä‚Ñ¢ ‚óä¬©‚óä√ª‚óä√¥‚óä√π the way God wants the world to be.<br/>How does that sound to you?<br/>What do you think?

The world's last experience in the 1930s with a demented leader of a major world power did not end well, when 100 million are estimated to have died in WW2.  We still do not know the bill in harm to humanity and the planet that will be presented as a result of Donald Trump's presidency.  It will probably be large unless he is stopped soon.","Try this, we are no where near what real full employment would be.

He promised the 44% of Americans who voted for him that just having him, a master negotiator, as president, would change America's future.  He, and the ""tough"" negotiators appointed by him, would jaw-bone foreign adversaries (China, Mexico, Canada, the EU) to give America a better deal.  All previous trade agreements were bad for Trump, and had given away the store.  Obama and Hillary were just more of the same.  But Trump would bring back American manufacturing with a roar.  That, and restricting immigration and keeping out colored and Muslim immigrants, would make America great again.  There is one thing in all this thread of argument and bogus logic: it's pure rubbish.  Trump is a pathological liar, con man, ignoramus, and cheat.  He scammed America.  Not only is he ignorant of every policy area including trade and immigration, he doesn't care that he doesn't know, but believes he knows more than any expert.  That's the definition of the dangerous fool.  America is heading for rough times, but the world also, thanks to America's choice (helped by Putin) in 2016.","There is some truth in Trump's comment about being ""down"" with other countries.  The countries that run the trade surpluses, especially China, are the ones who should fear a trade war the most as they have more to lose.  In order to get concessions - for example to get China and other countries to quit dumping, which is still common - it may be necessary to threaten a trade war.  When the other countries are  threatened, they will reply in kind, but such counterthreats may be largely empty.  But the US has power in these things which it has not been using, or which it has been using in the primary interests of corporate profits rather than those of American workers.<br/><br/>Winning even a war of bluffs will not be simple or easy, and Canada is not the country to even threaten a war with.

That said, owing to being a parent with a pre-school child, I've only been able to see a few Oscar-worthy films this year. I fell asleep twice watching The Post, but presumed Meryl Streep would be nominated as she was remarkable. The other Oscar film I did see, ""Get Out,"" was a bit of a disappointment, perhaps because I had read and heard so much about it before viewing. Not that I knew the whole plot and ending; I didn't. It disappointed because it was simply a good, at times a very clever film with fine acting, a good script and some interesting (albeit not very subtle!) racial commentary. It concerns me, though, that so many awards are being offered to a film and filmmaker for a work that seems simply good. It's biased, of course, to refuse to watch a film because one has prejudged it as ""not Oscar worthy."" But it's no less biased that that same film is so valorized, perhaps because it has a black star, co-star, with Jordan Peele at the helm as writer, director, and producer. I've been a Peele fan for years. He's brilliant. But this film of his is not brilliant. It is neither ""flawless,"" nor is it #MeToo. But it is very good.

It's a rarity for schools in affluent white neighborhoods to suffer abusive cops.<br/><br/>I don't dignify bad cops with the name 'officer'.  In the 90's the all-white cops in our low crime, 'changing' neighborhood, suburban high school in the 90's were so bad, good kids dropped out because of the daily harassment and bullying.  Mine was one of them, with my permission.  The only satisfaction comes from him being many more times successful - and a better human being - than any of those cops who made school life so miserable for him.  He's white. You can only imagine what it was like for the kids of color. ",One of the worst decisions in the history of education was the placement of police in schools instead of hiring enough teachers to reduce class size. It changed the whole environment in schools from one of nurturing and caring to one of enforcement and punishment. It will only get worse until we are willing to fund the real resources schools need and institute real gun control.

Big Biz and the best government money can buy treats small business as Wal-Mart treated them - under-price and put them out of business.  And today, it is like screaming across the vacuum of space to get a politician to pay attention.  Join a Pac if you want their ear, right?<br/><br/>Hello Trump, for we have had enough.

It seemed normal at the time, but looking back I suppose it was unusual to grow up in a country where many people had a sense of both innocence and tremendous power at the same time. Personally, in assessing that time I think one is well-advised to consider concurrently what a heady brew that combined sense of power and innocence was; the extent to which the feeling was justified by the WW II victory and US behavior and prosperity in the aftermath; and the extent to which the feeling was not justified because there was indeed racism and unnecessary poverty in the foundations of that world. <br/><br/>With my amateur‚Äö√Ñ√¥s sensibility about these matters I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t tell you why on the one hand the MetLife Building and the title music for the film How The West Was Won evoke that era for me; while on the other hand a picture of the Orange County Government Center in Goshen will cause me to opine to my companions ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The Greatest Generation liked ‚Äö√Ñ√≤em ugly; sometimes they‚Äö√Ñ√¥d even affirmatively cover up the detailing on the old Art Deco government buildings while they were building new stuff that looked like that.‚Äö√Ñ√π<br/><br/>Maybe those guys associated Art Deco with the Depression and the prelude to war; if a time machine were available I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d be willing to meet them halfway at the 1939 World‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Fair.","When I lived in Westchester, I loved to stroll along Park Avenue near Grand Central.

These two towers, along with the Lever House, should be protected as a group. <br/><br/>Too often in our country we focus on protecting individual buildings instead of neighborhoods/districts. Then we wonder why European cities are so much more charming! The loss of the Chase/Union Carbide building will damage the integrity of the entire area, Seagram and Lever included. Why not keep them and encourage lower rise development elsewhere to meet demand?

When APS showed up to the house, he was there, lied and told APS that he was living there and caring for her, and she refused to let them come in, so APS just closed the case.

It is produced as a product to market and therefore, like cars or other items in the marketplace, caters to the customer. Some people like trucks, some like sedans, some like SUVs and the whole world knows what you like when you drive down the street.<br/><br/>Porn is consumed in private and no one need know your preference. You can be Roy Moore demanding judgment on all sinners in public and, home alone, watch sex acts that degrade women (or other men) and, because you participate in the marketplace, someone will make sure you get what you want.<br/><br/>So ""good"" porn, which I guess would be the depiction of an act of caring and respect, as well as lust, between partners, could be, and is, made, but it isn't all that is made-not even close. The ""bad"" porn that is produced, physical victimization of one person by another through sex, is a social danger, particularly for young males, because it corrupts what physical intimacy should mean. At the worst it may, for those most impressionable, ruin their chance for a full life. At the least it validates fantasies that should be left under the rock. <br/><br/>So the problem isn't that all porn is created equal. The problem is like the serpent in the garden.  ""Bad"" porn may only be a part of all that is there but its existence overwhelms all else in the porn universe.","Good argument. I'm not sure the porn industry should really have to defend itself though. As long as you're operating within the boundaries of existent law, there's not really any need to provide an explanation. Politicians are making an issue out of the porn industry in the same way Wisconsin attacks teachers or Trump promotes coal. The conservative argument is actually to leave well enough alone.<br/><br/>If I learned about specifically harmful or abusive practices within the porn industry, I would advocate policy action. Without that information though, I can't really form an opinion. I don't think children are any better or worse off for accessing internet porn. Does a women's lingerie catalog promote healthier ideas about sexuality? Besides, kids have video text now anyway. They're going to figure things out somehow. Otherwise, the human race is in trouble.<br/><br/>Speaking of context though, I once read an interesting research paper outlining black market impacts. You would be absolutely shocked at how bad outcomes are for sex workers where transactional sex is illegal. Individuals in the sex industry fare way better in Las Vegas then anywhere else. Turns out the ethical thing to do is to protect workers in the sex industry rather than push them to the margins. The industry will exist with or without your approval."

Dianne Feinstein's fall from grace was reactionary to the internal politics of the 2016 elections. Democratic party leadership forced Clinton on an electorate that didn't want her and she lost like everyone knew she would. Clintonian neo-liberalism is dead in the 20-teens. The party simply hasn't figured that out yet. The party no longer represents the demographic seeking their representation. As you can imagine, voters are rather upset.<br/><br/>There are many forces at work contributing to Democratic entropicalism. However, the core dissatisfaction stems from two factors. First, the ""machine"" is designed to play on a field that no longer exists. Second, the tent is trying to house too many people wearing too many different hats. As result, we have an unresponsive and uncoordinated mishmash of clucking show birds. Republicans suffer from a similar problem but they've seemed to accomplish an agenda anyway.<br/><br/>Now would be a good moment for an end to the two party system. Instead of shoving everybody into one of two tents, different parties should allow representation for different core principles while still forming governing coalitions.

Since then, I have offered sympathy to parents and grandparents as teen fatalities pile up. One factor not mentioned in the editorial is alcohol use. In some communities there is a culture of early age drinking that makes driving almost suicidal not to mention potentially homicidal. ","I remember the New Jersey graduated license program. I can't say the program was very effective though. The only people enforcing the intermediate license restrictions were parents. A police officer was not going to pull you over for looking young. I still don't know anyone that ever received a ticket for violating the provisions of an intermediate license. Punishment was strictly parental. In which case, maybe teenagers aren't the problem.<br/><br/>I think 16 and 18 year olds are equally capable of operating 2,000 lb deadly vehicles if trained properly and kept on a short leash during the learning curve. Age is mostly irrelevant. You're confusing correlation with causation. The problem is too few parents, or instructors acting on their behalf, spend enough time educating young adults on how to drive properly. Actually, too few adults know how to drive properly themselves. Monkey see, monkey do. Bad habits follow bad examples.<br/><br/>I do support the idea of treating gun control as a public health issue though. People die by firearm. The public interest is generally best served by keeping people alive. Hence, we have a public health issue. Simple. I just don't want gun advocates to use data collection as an excuse to delay any action on gun control. I'm being generous in saying I'm willing to allow data to guide policy on gun control in the first place. However, how long has the tobacco industry been suppressing research on cigarettes?<br/><br/>This is my concern."

Tariffs will cause inflation. They always do. The question is simply a matter of when and how much.<br/><br/>That beer manufacturer isn't going to raise prices on a half-cent can immediately. However, they'll edge the cost onto wholesalers eventually. The big vendors will fare better. Smaller buyers will take a bigger hit on unit purchase price. The change is then reflected in consumer prices in turn. Once the first store jacks the price on a case of PBR, everyone will follow suit. The bigger retailers will pad their margins and the smaller ones will stay where they were before the tariff.<br/><br/>The car industry will follow the same basic model. If new construction costs more, you can expect rents on office and housing to gradually increase as well.<br/><br/>I'd generally agree with the basic assumption that tariff inflation won't be widespread throughout the economy. However, there is one important caveat. Companies might participate in margin swapping as a result of the price increase. Cars are more expensive as a result of steel.

I never thought I would write this:  If it is Trump's profound ignorance of foreign affairs alone that is keeping us from getting into war in the Middle East, I am grateful for a stupid president.  Mr. Stephens, you probably think we could have won the Iraqi and Vietnam wars if they had just been fought correctly.<br/>Please think through the possible unintended consequences of your military proposals and get back to us.  Thanks.","We did have a leader possessing all those qualities under Obama. You're missing the major blunder of the Iraq War though. We possess the military and diplomatic strength to conduct large scale operations against dictatorial powers as well the national interest to do so. However, we've lost the moral and political authority to aggressively pursue dictators as a result of the George W. Bush administration.<br/><br/>You can't point the finger too hard at anyone after you're caught overthrowing a foreign leader under false pretenses and then botching the essential nation rebuilding project that necessarily followed. Our hands were more or less tied. Contrary to the suggestion made here, the ""red line"" mistake didn't actually concern Obama's inaction at all. The mistake was uttering the threat out loud knowing he was incapable of taking action.<br/><br/>Granted, Trump is probably the worst possible leader to handle the situation now. I would rather see my high school football coach take the lead on our international policy. However, even a better leader would find the US position in Syria tenuous. We burned our global capital on Iraq. The Obama administration worked very hard to restore some of it. Trump has made the task of destroying it again his sworn duty."

I'd like to go beyond the blame game. The feelings of economic insecurity in this country seem pervasive.  I think even many rich people feel similarly.  Wealth is transient and can evaporate quickly.  Many businesses face increased competition around the world. High tech jobs are moving to India and China, not just low tech ones.  The feeling is that we are fighting over a smaller pie because no one knows how to make a bigger one.  Entrenched interests are also a major issue.  Spending on healthcare for example is much more per capita than other countries.  I'm willing to bet that China and Russia get more bang for the buck with their military spending as well. I don't have much faith that US government spending is efficient.   So the vote was more about taking money away from folks who don't appear to be spending it well.  As long as people feel the government isn't doing a good job, they will vote against it. The big flaw in my view of the ACA is that it added a lot of spending without addressing cost significantly.  Again, entrenched interests prevented real reform.  Automation and globalization eliminated a lot of American jobs.  How can we address the real issues?  How do we build common ground?"

Yet, there are very few states or municipalities which are able to fully fund these pension and health care obligations.  This means that either promises will be broken--or substantial tax increases will be required to keep them.  In some states, such as Illinois and California, those unfunded mandates have risen into the hundreds of billions of dollars--and the likelihood they can ever be covered--barring a massive taxpayer revolt, is doubtful.  <br/><br/>Needless to say--something has to give.  According to Stein's Law, ""If something cannot go on forever, it must stop"".  Now is the time.

NYC is spending about $3.4 billion in foregone property taxes, and  $1 billion in direct funding to produce about 24,000 units of affordable housing , a per unit cost of $183,000.   Most of this cost is absorbed by developers and builders and a low-income housing industrial complex, and relatively little is received by tenants in the form of lower rents.<br/>The much better approach is to give out housing vouchers to needy families and individuals and let them find their own place to rent or share with others.  Give each of about 25,000 households homeless each night in NYC a say $4,000 a month voucher to cover the entire rent somewhere.  This would cost $1.2 billion or  $48,000 per household per year, far less than the $183,000 per household building new units.  Then the remaining $3.4 billion now spent on new subsidized units could be given out as an average $500 a month housing voucher (varying depending on income of the household) that would help 550,000 households a month, and help prevent more homeless.<br/>So, most homelessness would be abolished and  a half million households  get a small subsidy to help pay their rent. ","How many of those impoverished New Yorkers in need of affordable housing also rely on government assistance for their entire income? (ie: they are unable to work). For this group NYC should 'think outside the box""! Instead of paying $40,000+ PER YEAR for subsidies, NYC should purchase thousands of housing units that sit vacant in upstate New York's small cities, such as Utica, Amsterdam, Troy, etc. Rather than wasting money building new units on very expensive Manhattan-Brooklyn-Queens real estate, move the people to where the housing already exists at very affordable prices!

These days, we have seemingly all the information we'd ever need at our fingertips, and in some ways, that's made life better for us. We're more aware than past generations - for example, you hardly ever meet someone who doesn't have an opinion about Trump these days, teens and kids included. However, as a result of that, we're also more aware of the injustices of this world, which can be a tricky thing. On the one hand, it can create a fire inside the hearts and minds of young people trying to change the world they live in, like how victims of the Parkland shooting are actively campaigning to pass gun reform laws because the People in Charge simply won't listen to them. On the other hand, though, it can make us pessimistic. Now that we're so aware of the problems we'll have to face as adults, we worry not only about short-term things like applying to college (which is also worlds harder than it used to be), we also worry about the long-term issues we face like a warming planet, which can be bad for our mental health. The good thing is that enough of us still have hope that we can make things better. We attend marches and protest online, we voice our concerns and make people listen if they don't hear us, we work hard even when our parents tell us we're lazy.

What would have resulted from those discussions likely would have been watered down, meaningless provisions. The E.U. cannot even make common cause against China as Germany has been known to put pressure on other member states when they want to get tough on China. China is an authoritarian, expansionist and mercantilist regime and the US has every right to retaliate against it as well as other countries that dump steel in the US and protect their own markets. The fact is, in order to re-establish the steel industry the US must impose tariffs on other countries that export steel. This is how things have been done for hundreds of years.

We exported more products than we imported giving us a very good balance on profitability on trade.<br/>In fact, US manufacturing saved the world from a catastrophic World War II by our ability to produce the necessary armaments to win the war.  After 1980, somewhat mysteriously, the US started becoming a service economy rather than a manufacturing one, which benefited the workers as well as the corporations. The unregulated global economy caused the change. Unfortunately multinational corporations' hunger for profits caused them to seek cheap labor abroad, damaging the US economy greatly. I've yet to see who deserves the blame for this change. It appears that US multinational corporations pulled the plug on American manufacturing simply to make more profits for themselves and the Wall Street bettors.<br/>As a result, we have large deficits in trade with China and others that keep getting worse, and the globalists ignore that fact as long as they are making more profits for themselves. Tariffs are our last way to balance our trade deficits. If trade wars result, so be it."

The president is a bully and has targeted his AG as his personal patsy for failing to recuse himself and thus shield him from Robert Mueller's scrutiny. <br/><br/>The president's me-first policy is exactly why this administration has failed so miserably. The president is trying to serve two masters at the same time, his business interests first and foremost, and the American people as an afterthought. Sessions again braved the abuse heaped on him by the president and remained in his post and put his country and his responsibilities first over his personal feelings of shame and humiliation. This president would do well to emulate his AG's devotion to duty. "

Maduro, and before him Ch‚àö¬∞vez, handed over the oil production industry to the military and other socialistic agencies of the government.  The result has been a breakdown of oil production, which with the decline in the Oil market, contributed to Venezuela‚Äö√Ñ√¥s economic woes.  As in Cuba, North Korea, etc., a centrally controlled socialist economy soon becomes incompetent, inefficient, and finally dysfunctional.  If you allow socialist idealists, ignorant of such things as supply and demand, run things in pursuit of utopian goals, then you get social and economic failure as well as corruption and hypocrisy.","The Venezuelan economy is an extreme version of the resource curse, also called the Dutch Disease after it was observed as Holland developed it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s natural gas resources in the post WWII period. What happens is that when an extracted resource, like oil in Venezuela‚Äö√Ñ√¥s case, becomes the economic foundation of a country it fosters public subsides, suppresses investment in other productive industries and becomes the funding source for extensive corruption and the development of an entrenched plutocratic elite. This is seen today in Russia, Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Gulf States and many other places. Norway learned from the Dutch experience and shunts its North Sea oil wealth into its sovereign wealth fund, out of reach of corrupt political elites and immunizing its economy from much of the distorting effect. Venezuelan took the opposite path, poisoning it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s economic potential by using oil wealth as an unsustainable public subsidy and political influence tool. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s recovery will take at least a decade, once it starts, but the starting point will only be reached after the current political crisis burns itself out. The tragedy is that ongoing oil production will continue to fuel the crisis."

Because that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the case, many professionals now advocate that housing and other programs for those battling addiction NOT insist on sobriety in order to begin or to continue treatment.  Instead, they suggest that treatment focus on using reasonable means to reduce the harm caused by addiction, over a lengthy period, knowing that relapse will probably occur.  In the same way, perhaps we should focus efforts on folks like Nakesha on providing the best care possible while they continue to live on the street.  Mobile medical teams, portable showers and laundry facilities, street side grills for food prep and cooking, etc., may be the only ‚Äö√Ñ√∫help‚Äö√Ñ√π souls such as Nakesha will accept.

After all, annuities are the traditional way of doing this. <br/><br/>Having recently retired from a freelance career, and having saved a substantial amount of money, I am currently struggling with the choice of buying an annuity versus simply amortizing my savings on my own (or some combination thereof). From the research I've done so far, it appears that, despite whatever costs are built in, the payouts from annuities appear to be pretty good, and, of course, are guaranteed, at least for your life, or for a period certain, with a slightly lower payout. Furthermore, just like with Social Security, the longer you live, the better you make out. <br/><br/>Going the self-amortization route is a gamble in it's own right. It leaves you having to continue investing your money and hoping for the best. With the market at an all-time high right now, the downside risk with equities is significant. And fixed income returns, while trending upward, are still pretty meager. As someone who's kind of wrung out from all the ups and downs in the investment world I've lived through, the case for dispensing with the guesswork and uncertainty, taking my profits, and converting what I have into a guaranteed income stream, is very compelling.

The American steel and aluminum industries did not die just because of competition from off-shore companies any more than it died because of labor union wages.  Although these are factors, the bulk of the blame should be laid at the feet of the industry executives who either couldn't or wouldn't see that the WWII / post war boom could not last forever; would not see the need to spend money on modernization, innovation and adapting to market changes (much like the American automotive industry).  Their first solutions were to  move to non-union states seeking lower labor costs and to lobby extensively for laws that would allow them to become off-shore companies - again in search of the least expensive labor.  An important factor is the rise of the new CEO class who have no history of doing a business that makes things; they are financial people who come in, reshuffle the business, get a sharp rise in income ( selling off assets, reducing cost anyway that is possible) take a big compensation and exit  -before the crash.  American greed for the big, quick payoff, rather than the slow gradual accumulation of wealth through years of doing good business is what has killed the American steel and aluminum industries and they do excellent PR jobs of shifting that blame off on to others - it is always the fault of someone else!

Governor Christie had worked to set up a great start to President Trump‚Äö√Ñ√¥s transition. But the President allowed Kushner to undercut the Governor and have him fired as the transition director.
